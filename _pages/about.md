I am a PhD student in the department of Computer Science at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), working on designing Approximation Algorithms. I am interested in several aspects of Mathematical Computer Science and Theoretical Machine Learning.

I am currently advised by [Lorenzo Orecchia](orecchia.net).

Prior to joining the University of Chicago I completed a Master of Science degree in Computer Science at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu) and a Master of Engineering degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) in the UK.
