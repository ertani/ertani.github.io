I am a computer scientist and mathematician working on solving algorithmic challenges arising in data science. I am interested in several aspects of mathematical computer science and theoretical machine learning.

This fall I am visiting the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago working with [Yury Makarychev](https://home.ttic.edu/~yury/). I obtained my PhD in computer science from the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). 

Interested in my work? Check out my Publications page above.
