I am a PhD student in the department of Computer Science at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), working on designing Approximation Algorithms. I am interested in several aspects of Mathematical Computer Science and Theoretical Machine Learning.

I am lucky to be mentored by [Yury Makarychev](https://home.ttic.edu/~yury/), [Lorenzo Orecchia](https://www.orecchia.net), and [Ali Vakilian](http://www.mit.edu/~vakilian/).

Prior to joining the University of Chicago I completed a Master of Science degree in Computer Science at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu) and a Master of Engineering degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) in the UK.
