I am a PhD student in the department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago, working on designing Approximation Algorithms. I am interested in several aspects of Mathematical Computer Science and Theoretical Machine Learning.

I am currently advised by [Lorenzo Orecchia](orecchia.net).

Prior to joining the University of Chicago I completed a Master of Science in Computer Science at Boston University and a Master of Engineering degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bristol in the UK.
