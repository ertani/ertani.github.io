He was just a great TA in general who knows how to help students better understand the material and work through their problems. I really commend him for his patience and ability to really get students to learn in the interactions with him.", "ERASMO: you're awesome","Erasmo Tani was an amazing TA who re–explained lecture concepts well, clearly demonstrated relevant mathematical techniques, facilitated problem solving as a group, and was a positive and encouraging presence that greatly enhanced in my experience in this course.","Erasmo is so nice. He is very patient in explaining homework and complex concepts to us. I think he is one of the best TA in our university!", "[Another TA] and Erasmo — they were great!!!
